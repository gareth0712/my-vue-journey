      <h2>My course goals</h2>
      <input type="text" v-model="enteredGoalValue" />
      <button @click="addGoal">Add Goal</button>
      <p v-if="goals.length === 0">
        No goals have been added yet - please start adding some!
      </p>
      <ul v-else>
        <!-- When we click the add button, only new item is added instead of refreshing the whole list -->
        <!-- "goal in goals" here is the same as "goal of goals" in Javascript -->
        <!-- <li v-for="goal in goals">{{ goal }}</li> -->
        <li
          v-for="(goal, index) in goals"
          :key="goal"
          @click="removeGoal(index)"
        >
          <!-- Dynamic element -->
          <p>{{ goal }} - {{ index }}</p>
          <!-- The text input inside input DOM element is not dynamic and thus is not copied by Vue -->
          <input type="text" @click.stop />
          <!-- 
            Key explained in detail to avoid a Vue bug:

            What if we do not provide the key attribute?
            <li v-for="(goal, index) in goals" @click="removeGoal(index)">
              <p>{{ goal }} - {{ index }}</p>
              <input type="text" @click.stop />
            </li>

            Without key attribute, Vue is not able to differentiate each DOM element.
            In order to optimize performance, whenever we delete an item from the list,
            Vue doesn't rerender the whole list or remove the current item. It merely removes the last item.
            It copies the dynamic content of the next item to the current item and continue the process until it removes the last item.

            For example,
            Say that we add two elements: a and b
            We type something in the elements, say "123" in a and "456" in b. 
            If we delete item a, behind the scene, Vue copies the dynamic content (i.e. "{{ goal }} - {{ index }}" in <p> tag) of second item
            and pastes to the first item and deletes the second item => So we see "b - 0" as the first item afterwards
            Refer to vueBug01.png and vueBug02.png for a better picture

            However, what about the content we typed in the input box? As in the vueBug02.png, we have 123 in "b - 0"
            But actually we want 456 there.

            How to resolve it? We know Vue does that because there is no unique identifier and Vue won't go into each rendered element to compare the content for sake of performance.
            
            With "key" attribute, it serves as an unique identifier that Vue can detect and understands that the DOM elements are different from each other.
            Now Vue is able to detect that the first DOM element needs to be removed in order to not lose any data attached to the second element.
            
            As a result, we can refer to vueBugResolvedWithKeyAttribute.png to see the difference.

            Remarks:
            Key is an optional attribute but it is always suggested to use it whenever we use v-for.
            key is also a dynamic value determined by the goal here, and so we should use v-bind
            With the unique identifier, Vue is able to tell the difference and the bug is therefore resolved
            We should not use "index" as the unique identifier as it changes whenever an item is removed
            We can then use "goal" as it seems to be unique enough. lets assume we do not input repeated goal atm.

        <!-- We can also loop through an object -->
        <!-- <li v-for="(value, key) in {name: 'Max', age: 31}">
          {{ key }}: {{ value }}
        </li> -->
        <!-- 1st: "name: Max" ; 2nd: "age: 31" -->
        <!-- Object can also has their index -->
        <!-- <li v-for="(value, key, index) in {name: 'Max', age: 31}">
          {{ key }}: {{ value }} in index {{ index }}
        </li> -->
        <!-- Can work with numbers -->
        <!-- <li v-for="num in 10">{{ num }}</li> -->
